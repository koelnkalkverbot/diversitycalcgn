# Diversity Calendar Cologne
An Android app that visually represents the open data set "diversity calendar cologne": https://offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/diversity-kalender-koeln

The term **diversity** describes the fact that people differ from each other in many ways - based on age, gender, religion or belief, ethnic origin and skin colour, sexual identity, disability and family situation.

In order to ensure equal appreciation of all diversity groups at a glance, the calendar includes the holidays of the major religious communities within the Cologne population as well as secular holidays.
